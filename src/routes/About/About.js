          <p>
          In my current role, I am primarily responsible for resolving issues related to the installation, updates, and upgrades of Windows systems across various environments.

          <p>
          Privately, I am a dedicated programming enthusiast, interested in this field for many years. 
          I am familiar with a range of programming languages at different proficiency levels, but recently, I have been most focused on developing web applications and implementing AI solutions using Python and TypeScript.
          I took part in a various frontend and fullstack projects as a freelance developer.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm currently focused on a career transition into a Software Developer role.
          I am very eager to work as a full-time programmer because I know that writing code and designing applications is something that brings me great joy.
          </p>
          <p>
          My current role has taught me not only how to thoroughly analyze code and logs but also how to react effectively in critical situations. Every day, I am involved in problem-solving and testing new solutions. 
          These skills are very beneficial to my programming efforts as they have instilled patience and critical thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
          Additionally, I hold a postgraduate degree from the Faculty of Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w. 
          The specialization I studied there provided me with many practical skills related to implementing AI systems, software architecture, MLOps, as well as some fundamentals of DevOps.
          </p>
          <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching automotive and technology-related content, working out, and spending time with my family and friends.
